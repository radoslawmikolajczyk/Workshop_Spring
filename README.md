1. You need to have Java JDK (at least 11) installed. To verify 
2. Checkout the project and import it in your favorite IDE (we like IntelliJ IDEA the most).
3. Run

`./gradlew clean build` (for linux/osx)

or

`gradlew.bat clean build` (for windows)

inside the project directory to check if everything works.
